The FuqIt Web Framework
=======================

I'm kind of tired of following the stupid rules of MVC and want to just
try out making something where I shit files into a directory and they
just work.  This Python web framework (if you can call it that) is my
first crack at something like that.  I basically did this on a Saturday
morning because I was bored.  If you don't like it, then oh well, life
goes on.

How It Works
============

1. mkdir app
2. touch app/__init__.py
4. mkdir app/static
4. python fuqit.py app 0.0.0.0 8080
5. Put .py files or "anything else" into app.
6. The .py files need a run function.  It gets variables.
7. Anything else is a jinja2 template.

That's it.  Look in this project's app/ directory to see me
doing stupid crap with it to see if it works.

Resolution Order
================

Easy, and oh so hackable so don't run this crap on any computer you
care about.

0. If it's in /static/ it's a static file.
1. If it has an extension it's a template.
2. If it ends in / it's either /index.html or /index.py
3. Otherwise it's a module named after the path with / changed to .
unless there is a directory with the same path, then this will produce a redirect.

Examples:

* / -> /index.html or /index.py
* /the/stupid/place/stuff.txt -> jinja template same path
* /the/other/place/index.html -> same thing
* /mystuff/cool -> a module named app.mystuff.cool
* /dir/that/exists -> redirect to /dir/that/exists/

It uses the python mimetypes module to figure out mimetypes by extension. No, I don't
know how to add new extensions to it.

Using It
========

You can play with the example by doing this::

    export PYTHONPATH=.
    python fuqit/server.py app 127.0.0.1 8000

Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and you'll get my little demo testing app.
It's in the app directory and just has some files for testing the rendering.


But That's Magic!

Investor Statement
==================

Do you have a load of money and are you looking for the next Meteor to waste it
on?  Well this project is currently looking for funding and it's already been
on the top of HackerNews!

Act fast because pretty soon I'll have a spare Sunday and FuqIt will become
more secure than both Meteor and Ruby On Rails and then you'll miss out on
investing in the next hottest thing.  You'll have to go buy some Gucci hand
bags or a DVF dress to be in-fashion instead.  Can't have that now.
